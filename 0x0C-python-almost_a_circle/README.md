# Python-Almost a circle

This project helps me to get ready for the AirBnB project which is a big part of the Higher level curriculum.

In this project, I get to review everything about python:
* Import
* Exceptions
* Class
* Private attribute
* Setter/Getter
* Static method
* Class method
* Inheritance
* Unittest
* Readdd/Write file

Including:
- _*args_ and _**kwargs_
- Serialization/Deserialization
- JSON

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
* All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS usin python3(version 3.8.5)
* All files should end with  new line
* The first line of all the files should be exactly _#!/usr/bin/python3_
* The code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.)
* All the files must be executable
* All the modules should be documented
* All the classes shoud be documented
* All functions(inside and outside a class)0 should be documented

### Python Unit Tests
* All files should end with a new line
* Al the files should be inie a folder *tests*
* Use the _unittest module_
* All the test files should be python files(extension: .py)
* All test files and folders should start with *test_*
* The file organization in tests folders should be the same as the project: ex: for _models/base.py_, unit tests must be in: *tests/test_models/test_base.py*
* All tests should be executed by using this command: _python3 -m unittest discover tests_
* The test files can also be tested using this command: _python3 -m unitest tests/test_models/test_base.py_
