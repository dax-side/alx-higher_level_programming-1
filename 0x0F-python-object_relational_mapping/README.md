# Python -Object-relational mapping
In this project I will be linking two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!
In the first part, I will use the module MySQLdb to connect to a MYSQL database and execute the SQL queries.
In the second part I will use the module SQLAlchemy and Object Relational Mapper(ORM).
